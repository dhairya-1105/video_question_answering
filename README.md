INTRODUCTION:
This approach to the problem statement proposes combining the vector embeddings of the
frame-based GIFs and text-based questions in the latent space using cross-attention and
concatenated embeddings to gather context from the image and enable open-vocabulary answering
capabilities. The approach was derived from Language Grounded QFormer for Efficient Vision
Language Understanding.
